# Serlialized Python Objects

The goal of this project is to develop skills around serializing Python classes to and from both SQL and JSON.

User Story:
AS A financial analyst
I WANT TO map my companies across various things like KPIS and SECTORS
SO THAT I can visualize mappings easily in an app with JSON but also maintain a second form database structure
